**🧮 Calculator WCF Service (SOAP + REST)**

A simple WCF-based calculator service that exposes the same business logic through both SOAP and REST endpoints.

This project demonstrates how one service can support multiple communication styles using different bindings.

**📌 What This Project Demonstrates**

    WCF service hosting
    
    SOAP vs REST comparison
    
    Contract-based design
    
    DataContract usage
    
    Multi-endpoint configuration

**🔹 Layers**

1. Service Host
   
    Console application
   
    Configures endpoints
   
    Starts and stops the service

2. Service Contracts
   
    ICalcSOAPService
    
    ICalcRESTService

3. Service Implementation
   
    CalcService
   
    Contains shared business logic

4. Data Contract
   
    DataRequest (used for REST POST)

**🌐 Endpoints**

**🔵 SOAP Endpoint**

Binding: BasicHttpBinding

Format: XML

http://localhost:5000/CalculatorService/CalcSOAP

**🟢 REST Endpoints**

Binding: WebHttpBinding

Format: JSON

Addition (GET)

http://localhost:5000/CalculatorService/CalcREST/addition?a=5&b=3

Multiplication (POST)

http://localhost:5000/CalculatorService/CalcREST/mul-rest

Body :
{

      "A": 4,
      
      "B": 6
      
}

**🚀 How to Run**

1. Open solution in Visual Studio

2. Set CalculatorServiceHost as startup project

3. Run the application

4. Press Enter to stop the service
